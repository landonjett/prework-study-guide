# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

my motivation with this webpage is to help me navigate bootcamp with ease. I built this project to be better organized while i learn how to code. I have used this webpage to solve problems such as forgetting what commands to type and when. I've learned that coding is complex, but also hpw truly creative and expressive it is.
